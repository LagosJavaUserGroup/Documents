# Goals/Mission

The mission is to improve developer relations, growth in proficiency, and network for people within LagosJUG and beyond. Feel free to dive into our open-source ecosystem, where contributions are driven by passion and collaboration.

# Project
A Project at any point in time must have a Lead/Owner and at least 3 team members working to achieve a milestone within its defined scope under the supervision of the Lagos Admin. The Project Owner should document Each Milestone as a user story.

All Lagos JUG projects are Opensource projects, so we prioritize using free Opensource tools. 

Refer to our [Open Source Guides](https://github.com/LagosJavaUserGroup/Documents/tree/main)
